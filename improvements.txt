Initial Feedback from Puja:

- Clearly has a very personal style which is always nice to see. 
- Your home page is very clean which is great. 

Just a few minor points:
- The top bar with the logo and about me icon is cut off at the top
- One addition you could make to each project preview block on the home 
page could be to add tags to give an idea of what the project involved 
before clicking on it. This will help employers to find relevant content 
for the job you have applied for. *
- In project pages, include your key learnings from the project and maybe 
also what you plan to do to take it further. Listing soft skills is also 
quite important. *
- There are two spelling mistakes on the portable seat page. Passengers and 
Frequently - both in the first para i think
- There's potentially too much animation on the portable seat page which makes
 it difficult to focus on the information. I would make it more subtle.

Other than that it looks great, well done!

Feedback from Freya:
- Title of project pages next to words means you need to read too much. Maybe add
a picture to make it more visual or spread it out.

Feedback from Chris:
- The 'skills' bars should be clickable.
- The pictures on the home page should be clickable.
- The poster on the Gizmo page should be clickable.
- Needs to be responsive for the bigger screen.

Len:
- Change Barba Transition speeds
- Change cursor effect speeds. *

Layla (if that was her name):
Love the character
More arrows and sketchy stuff
More fun and styalised for the project pages
No about me section on the project pages.
